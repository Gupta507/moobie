  <h2>
    Why I created Moobie? 🤓
  </h2>
  <p>
    My main motive was to learn server side rendering in NextJs and how it is different from client side rendering. Creating a clean UI/UX web application is my hobbie and what i wanted was to provide the content to user without any annoying ads and popups.

## Workflow of moobie.
There is a backend which is scraping a website for the desired details the most of the complexity is working behind the UI. As backend is merged with consumet to get streaming links and show it to user.

- Backend
  - Scrapping a website to get desired details such as image source, title, etc.
  - Collecting it into an array of objects.
  - Created a route which returns those details.
  - Creation of backend was a new experience for me but it felt kind of easy not totally.
  - The main thing which gave problem to me was on deployment 😅.
  
- Frontend
  - Yellow theming as i am not a great ui designer but still made it look aesthetic and clean with all screen responsivness.
  - A Good looking landing page for the new user to get a brief why i created moobie.
  - I personally loves to add the toggle theming from `dark` to `light` still default will be `system`.
  - I Mostly used SSR which clearly hides the api calls in network section. somehow i loved this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am not sure if you should clone it or not as it uses the scrapper created by me. but still if you are into learning how UI/UX is working then go for it.
