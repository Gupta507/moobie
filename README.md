  <h2>
    Why I created Moobie? 🤓
  </h2>
  <p>
    My main motive was to learn server side rendering in NextJs and how it is different from client side rendering. Creating a clean UI/UX web application is my hobbie and what i wanted was to provide the content to user without any annoying ads and popups.
